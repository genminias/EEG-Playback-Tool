## **EEG Playback Tool**

### **Project Goal**

<!-- - Includes an analysis/metrics tool (TBD) -->

### **Project Approach / Technologies / API**
 - Electron
 - Javascript 
 - React
 - Node.js
 - Firebase
 - Highchart
 - Neurocity SDK and APIs
 <!-- - EEG Javascript Library (TBD) -->

### **Project Use Case**
> A user will log into our app. Once logged in, a user can select a dataset from their already saved data. Once the dataset is loaded into our app, a user can play back the data for inspection. <!-- A user can also choose to look at a list of all of their saved data sets and share certain ones with other users or make them publicly available. A user can also use an analysis tool to assist them in evaluating metrics. -->
